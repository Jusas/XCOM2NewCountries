**Updated 7th Feb**

Now with 16 new nationalities!

- Finland
- Estonia
- Latvia
- Lithuania
- Switzerland
- Austria
- Cuba
- Peru
- Chile
- New Zealand

Latest update added the following:

- Denmark
- Iceland
- Uruguay
- Jamaica
- Croatia
- Oman

Also fixed languages (some nationalities had 'englishUS' as language while it should have been 'english')

Each nation has a small set of names (~15 first and last names per gender), I've tried to maintain at least some accuracy in choosing them. Icelandic names for example have separate last names for male and female characters.

The mod should be compatible with other nationality/flag mods.

Enjoy!
